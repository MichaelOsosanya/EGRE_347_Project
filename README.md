>>>>>>> main
>>>>>>
CHANGES AS OF 12.10.23

So this gets a little confusing as Mike did not upload his full game file so I had to branch off of main then delete a bunch of files so i could completley upload the new version. but the MAIN changes I made were:

- made projectiles collide with each other
- gave enemies direction so they can shoot in the direction the player is in
- combined methods for player shooting mini bosses and all enemies shooting player

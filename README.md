Not sure why it won't change the read me but I will describe the changes here

CHANGES AS OF 11.27.23
- changed the camera so the character is in the second corner of the screen per Xander's request
- changed the gravity so the player could float
- got rid of jumping so the space could be the shoot projectile
- added ability to go up and down using the up and down arrow keys.
